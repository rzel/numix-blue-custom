# numix-blue-custom

Still VERY early development. I have really made none of these icons, but simply stole/copied them from other places. I have actually been using it for over a year myself, but never put it on github before, but figured I should give a little back to the comminity.. Maybe other people are as picky as me ;)

icon-theme goes very good in hand with my gtk-theme: https://github.com/vooze/arc-darker-ubuntu

Feel free to ask if some icons are weird or should be replaced with others!

# How to install icon theme

sudo apt install git unity-tweak-tool
git clone https://github.com/vooze/numix-blue-custom

# numix-blue-flat

Still VERY early development. I have really made none of these icons, but simply stole/copied them from other places.

icon-theme goes very good in hand with my gtk-theme: https://github.com/vooze/arc-darker-ubuntu

Feel free to ask if some icons are weird or should be replaced with others!
